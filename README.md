Raspberry Pi Xmas Tree
======================

Herein lies a repo containing some really poor attempts at using Ansible and
Python to control a Raspberry Pi Zero W with PiHut's [3D Xmas Tree](https://thepihut.com/products/3d-xmas-tree-for-raspberry-pi) kit attached.

By trade I normally do stuff with Chef and Ruby, so please don't expect anything
here to be ideomatic Ansible or Python. That said, comments and PRs are welcome.
